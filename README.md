# Project Summary
---

The goal of this project is to practice using javascript promises while making http requests, third-party
API's and manipulating the DOM to build rich user interactions.

To practice these skills you'll be building a small interactive game where a user can explore the Pokemon
world and catch Pokemon they find along the way.


## Resources

### API

To assist with building this game you need to utilize [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/). This is a free
third-party API containing all of the information we need to create our Pokemon game world.

You can find all of the documentation for the API at the link below, but the requirements will also
guide you to helpful API resources.

https://pokeapi.co/


### Fetch

Please use the **fetch** browser API to make your HTTP requests.

## Game Premise

This game is going to be very simple. The user will be able to select a **Region**, **Location**, and **Area**
they want to explore for Pokemon.

Once a user has selected the those three things, they should then be able to click a button to **Explore** the
selected **Area** for Pokemon.

Every **Area** has list of possible Pokemon that can be encountered there. A random Pokemon from the
currently selected area should be presented to the user as an **Encounter**.

When a Pokemon is Encountered the following details should be shown to the user:

Pokemon:

* Name
* Image
* Stats

There should then be another button that allows the user to **Catch** the encountered Pokemon.

When a Pokemon is caught, they should be added to a visible list of captured Pokemon for the user.

## Requirements

When a user initially navigates to the PokeCatcher game page they should be able to select a **Region**
they would like to explore.

> Hint:
>
> You can get a list of regions in the Pokemon universe by utilizing the pokeapi endpoint:
>
> https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/region


After a **Region** has been selected the user should then be able to select a **Location** within
that region.

> Hint:
>
> You can get a list of locations within a region by querying a regions's details and then inspecting
> the "locations" property of the returned region data.
>
> Query region details: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/region/{regionName}

After a **Location** has been selected a user should then be able to select an **Area** within that location.

> Hint:
>
> You can get a list of areas within a location by querying a location's details and then inspecting
> the "areas" property of the returned data.
>
> Query location details: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/location/{locationName}


Now that a **Region**, **Location** and **Area** have been selected the user should be able to press
a button to "Explore" the area. When a user "Explores" an area a possible Pokemon encounter needs to be
selected. Every **Area** has a list of possible Pokemon that can be encountered there. A Pokemon should
then be randomly selected from that encounter list and displayed to the user.

> Hint:
>
> To get the possible Pokemon encounters you'll need to query the area's details.
>
> Query area details: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/location-area/{areaName}

When a random Pokemon from the area has been selected for an encounter details for that Pokemon should
be shown to the user. Users should see an image of the Pokemon being encountered, the name of the Pokemon,
as well as the base stats of the encountered Pokemon.

> Hint: You can get details for a Pokemon by querying the api and inspecting the returned data.
>
> Query Pokemon details: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemonName}


A user should then have a way to **Catch** a Pokemon. When a Pokemon is caught they should be added to
an area of the UI where the user can see all of the Pokemon that they have caught. Users should never be
able to have more than 6 caught Pokemon at once.

When a Pokemon is caught, the encounter should be cleared and the user told to explore for more Pokemon.

## Finished

If you have time, you can add any other features you think would be interesting or make the user experience
better.
